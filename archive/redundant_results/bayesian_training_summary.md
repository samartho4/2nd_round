# Bayesian Training Fix Summary

## Configuration Changes
- Train samples: 5000 (increased from 2000)
- Train warmup: 1000 (increased from 500)
- Tuning samples: 1000 (increased from 500)
- NUTS target: 0.65 (more conservative)
- Solver tolerances: 1e-5 (relaxed for stability)

## Goals
1. Achieve proper Bayesian uncertainty (non-zero parameter std)
2. Improve posterior exploration with more samples
3. Better numerical stability
4. More realistic uncertainty quantification

## Status
Training completed with improved Bayesian settings.
Check parameter uncertainty analysis above for results.
