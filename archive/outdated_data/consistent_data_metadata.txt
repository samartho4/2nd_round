Generated: 2025-08-17T20:05:09.127

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Overlapping time windows: train(0-48h), val(36-84h), test(72-120h)
2. Consistent initial conditions across splits
3. Same physics model for all splits
4. SOC constrained to [0.0, 1.0] range

DATA SUMMARY:
Training samples: 30
Validation samples: 31
Test samples: 30
Total scenarios: 90

PHYSICS MODEL:
- Original equations from paper
- SOC bounds constraints added
- Consistent parameters across splits
