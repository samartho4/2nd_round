### Model Comparison
| Aspect | UDE | BNODE | Winner |
|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| **Parameters** | 20 | 35 | UDE |
| **Training Time** | 33.05s | ~826.3s | **UDE (25x faster)** |
| **x1 (SOC) R²** | -0.1895 | -0.1895 | Tie |
| **x2 (Power) R²** | 0.9471 | 0.9471 | Tie |
| **Overall Score** | 0.471 | 0.377 | **UDE** |
