## ðŸ“‹ **CONCLUSION**

The literature review reveals significant opportunities for novel contributions in hybrid physics-neural modeling for microgrid control. While substantial progress has been made in Neural ODEs, UDEs, and Bayesian methods, there remain critical gaps in:

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Convergence and complexity bounds for hybrid models
2. **Adaptive Frameworks**: Automatic model selection based on requirements
3. **Control Integration**: Uncertainty-aware control policies

Our research can address these gaps by developing:

The foundation is solid, but significant work is needed to meet NeurIPS standards. The key is to move beyond simple comparison to novel methodological contributions with theoretical backing and real-world validation.
